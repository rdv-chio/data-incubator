What are the factors that affect entrepreneurship in a country?
We all know that there are many important entrepreneurship hubs both in the USA and globally. And it seems to be that places with small businesses tend to bring in more small businesses, but what about other areas? Is it possible to identify countries where there is a pre-entrepreneurship boom? Identifying this places would be a tremendous oportunity to invest in places where there is no competition to find the best startups, and obtain the benefits of the successful ones at a better price than in traditional places.

However, in the world, there are many places that do not have either the infrastructure nor the culture of startup cities like Boston, Tel Aviv, Sillicon Valley, etc. However, they do have traditional word of mouth reputation, interesting and inexpensive approaches to certain problems, good craftmanship, and, more recently, extensive cellular access. In order to start looking at this idea, I have downloaded the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data, this is highly curated, longitudinal information of entrepreneurship in multiple countries, looking at different parameters.

If I were to do this project, I would want to in the end be able to provide countries, or ideally, regions, where are the more interesting startup locations in the next years, showcasing the advantages, characteristics and opportunities of each area.
